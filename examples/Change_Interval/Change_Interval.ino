  The ESP32-C3 has two timer groups, each one with one general purpose hardware timer. All the timers are based on 64 bits
  counters and 16 bit prescalers. The timer counters can be configured to count up or down and support automatic reload
  and software reload. They can also generate alarms when they reach a specific value, defined by the software. The value
  of the counter can be read by the software program.

  Now even you use all these new 16 ISR-based timers,with their maximum interval practically unlimited (limited only by
  unsigned long miliseconds), you just consume only one ESP32-C3 timer and avoid conflicting with other cores' tasks.
  The accuracy is nearly perfect compared to software timers. The most important feature is they're ISR-based timers
  Therefore, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions / tasks.
  This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks.

/*
   Notes:
   Special design is necessary to share data between interrupt code and the rest of your program.
   Variables usually need to be "volatile" types. Volatile tells the compiler to avoid optimizations that assume
   variable can not spontaneously change. Because your function may change variables while your program is using them,
   the compiler needs this hint. But volatile alone is often not enough.
   When accessing shared variables, usually interrupts must be disabled. Even with volatile,
   if the interrupt changes a multi-byte variable between a sequence of instructions, it can be read incorrectly.
   If your data is multiple variables, such as an array and a count, usually interrupts need to be disabled
   or the entire sequence of your code which accesses the data.

   This example will demonstrate the nearly perfect accuracy compared to software timers by printing the actual elapsed millisecs.
   Being ISR-based timers, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions / tasks, such as connecting to WiFi, Internet
   and Blynk services. You can also have many (up to 16) timers to use.
   This non-being-blocked important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks.
   You'll see blynkTimer is blocked while connecting to WiFi / Internet / Blynk, and elapsed time is very unaccurate
   In this super simple example, you don't see much different after Blynk is connected, because of no competing task is
   written
